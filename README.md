## 🌿 System Design or Project Pipeline  

To simplify the complexity of our pipeline, we divide it into two main components:  

1. **Training Pipeline**  
2. **Prediction Pipeline + AI Agents**  

### 🔧 Training Pipeline

*This is how **Training Pipeline** looks like*  

![training  pipeline](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e70008f-ae61-4c3c-8d01-ba92485c2c14)


First, we will retrieve data from **S3** as part of the **Data Ingestion Process** using this script from `utils`.  


<img width="820" alt="s3_config" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ec531d4-c595-4762-9e7f-53e7a69a33a0" />

- The `download_file` method:
  - Retrieves the file size using `head_object` for accurate progress tracking.
  - Uses `TransferConfig` to enable efficient multipart downloads (5MB chunks).
  - Implements a **progress callback** (`ProgressPercentage`) to log real-time updates.
  - Logs the start and completion of the download process for better visibility.
  - Handles errors gracefully by raising a `CustomException` on failure.

- The `run()` method acts as an entry point to execute the download seamlessly

###  Data Ingestion

After downloading the dataset from **S3** as `leaflogic_dataset.zip`, it is stored in the **data_ingestion_dir**. The script then extracts the dataset into the **feature_store_path**, ensuring the data is properly organized for further processing.

*This is the shot of only `initiate_data_ingestion` for more go to `src/leaflogic/components/data_ingestion.py`
<img width="815" alt="Screenshot 2025-03-01 101319" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a41a758-72b1-4f56-8a89-8e77b4faf17f" />


- **Initialization (`__init__` Method)**:  
  - Sets up the data ingestion directory.  
  - Logs initialization status.  

- **Data Download (`download_data` Method)**:  
  - Downloads the dataset from **S3** and saves it as `leaflogic_dataset.zip`.  
  - Uses **S3FileDownloader** to fetch the file.  

- **Data Extraction (`extract_zip_file` Method)**:  
  - Extracts `leaflogic_dataset.zip` into a temporary directory.  
  - Moves only the relevant dataset (`leaflogic_dataset`) into the **feature_store_path**.  
  - Cleans up temporary files after extraction.  

- **Data Ingestion Pipeline (`initiate_data_ingestion` Method)**:  
  - Calls the download and extraction methods in sequence.  
  - Returns a **DataIngestionArtifact**, storing paths to the downloaded and extracted dataset.  
  - Ensures proper logging and exception handling to track failures efficiently.  


### Prepare  BaseModel

After **data ingestion**, we prepare the base model by configuring `yolov5s.yaml` into `custom_yolov5s.yaml`. This involves updating the **number of categories (nc)** from `data.yaml` and defining essential parameters such as the **backbone, head, and other configurations** for training.

*This is the shot of only `prepare_basemodel` for more go to `src/leaflogic/components/prepare_base_model.py`
<img width="818" alt="Screenshot 2025-03-01 101223" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa500189-bba4-4bc5-9a09-253a3f49af7f" />

- **Initialization (`__init__` Method)**:  
  - Loads the data ingestion artifacts.  
  - Locates `data.yaml` to retrieve the number of classes (`nc`).  
  - Ensures the file exists before proceeding.  

- **Updating Model Configuration (`update_model_config` Method)**:  
  - Reads `data.yaml` to extract the number of categories.  
  - Loads the base YOLOv5 model config (`yolov5s.yaml`).  
  - Updates the `nc` field along with other essential configurations.  
  - Saves the modified configuration as `custom_yolov5s.yaml`,  
    but for **preserving the original structure**, we have written a custom `write_yaml_file` function in `utils`.  
    When modifying the `nc` parameter, the default YAML formatting would break, so this function ensures the correct structure is maintained.
  
*these are the shots of `write_yaml_file` for maintaining structure from `utils`  
<img width="813" alt="wt" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ced94e0e-b236-4f3b-a0db-86ab8222b544" />

<img width="812" alt="wr2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/184f09f6-db55-4b34-85f1-e11298f1d07e" />

*back to `prepare_basemodel`*
- **Model Preparation (`prepare_model` Method)**:  
  - Calls `update_model_config()` to generate the custom YOLOv5 config.  
  - Returns an artifact containing the path to the updated configuration file.  
  - Ensures all changes are logged for tracking and debugging. 

###  Model Trainer
After preparing the base model, we proceed to **training**. This stage utilizes the `data_ingestion` and `prepare_base_model` artifacts to train the model effectively.

  

*These are the shots of only `initiate_model_trainer` for more go to `src/leaflogic/components/model_training.py`
<img width="848" alt="mt" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04069879-a048-48e5-bc8e-5cfeca989738" />
<img width="806" alt="mt2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb6abdd5-f009-45b3-96f8-d980fb6660f1" />

During this stage:
- We **relocate** dataset files (`train`, `valid`, `test`, `data.yaml`) to the root directory to simplify file path management during training.  
- We **initiate the training** process using YOLOv5, specifying the dataset, model architecture, training parameters, and hardware configurations.  
- After training, we **move the best-trained model (`best.pt`)** to the root directory for easier access.  
- Finally, we **clean up unnecessary files** from the root directory to maintain a structured workspace. 

 *code overview* 
 
- **Initialization (`__init__` Method)**:  
  - Loads the **data ingestion** and **base model preparation** artifacts.  
  - Retrieves essential file paths such as `data.yaml`, the updated model config, and the model trainer directory.  
  - Ensures that `data.yaml` and the model config exist before proceeding.  

- **Moving Data for Training (`move_data_files_to_root` Method)**:  
  - Moves `data.yaml`, `train`, `valid`, and `test` directories from `feature_store_path` to the root directory.  
  - This ensures compatibility with the training script.  

- **Model Training (`initiate_model_trainer` Method)**:  
  - Moves data files to the root directory for ease of training.  
  - Runs the **YOLOv5 training script** with the correct configurations.  
  - Saves the **best model (`best.pt`)** to the root directory for easier access.  
  - Deletes unnecessary files (`data.yaml`, `train`, `valid`, `test`) after training is complete.  

- **Post-Training Cleanup (`delete_data_files_from_root` Method)**:  
  - Removes `data.yaml`, `train`, `valid`, and `test` directories from the root after training.  
  - Ensures a clean working environment.  

### ** and here the *training pipeline* ends **

### 🔍 Prediction Pipeline + AI Agents  

Now that we have successfully trained our model, let's move on to the **prediction pipeline** and **AI agents**. This phase involves using the trained model to detect objects in images and leveraging AI agents to fetch relevant insights about the detected crops/plants.  

### ** now let's talk about our Prediction Pipeline + AI Agents**

*This is how **Prediction Pipeline + AI Agents** looks like* 

![CI_CD Diagram (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/753c187e-e67f-4162-a4c3-e1a959a69113)

first let me take you to the tour of `app.py` that is present in `root directory` that orchestrates the object detection and AI research pipeline. It first defines necessary paths and functions to handle detection, processing, and research execution.

#### 1. Defining Paths and Functions  
Before executing the pipeline, the script defines essential paths and utility functions to manage object detection and research processing.

#### 2. Fetching the Latest Experiment Folder  
The function `get_latest_exp_folder()` retrieves the most recent experiment folder stored in `yolov5/runs/detect`. This ensures that the latest detection results are used in the pipeline.

#### 3. Running Object Detection  
To perform object detection, the script executes `run_yolo_detection()`, which utilizes the `os.system` command to run the YOLO model. The detected results are stored inside `detected_objects.txt`.

#### 4. Processing Predictions  
The detected indices are mapped to category labels using `process_prediction()`. This function relies on `get_label_by_idex` from `utils`, which compares each detected index with the categories defined in `data.yaml`.

#### 5. Reading Detected Objects  
The function `read_detected_objects()` reads the detected object labels from `detected_objects.txt`. These labels are then passed to AI agents for further analysis.

#### 6. Executing AI Research  
To gather insights on detected objects, `execute_research_and_report()` is invoked. This function triggers multiple research tasks:  
   - `research_overall_web` – General web research  
   - `research_health` – Health-related information  
   - `research_season` – Seasonal relevance  
   - `research_price` – Market price analysis  

#### 7. Saving and Summarizing Results  
The research findings are stored in `research_results`, and the `generate_summaried_report()` function compiles a final summarized report.

This structured approach ensures an efficient pipeline, from object detection to AI-powered analysis and reporting.

*almost every function in `app.py` is invoked by `/predict` route*, after all of it the report is sent to email -> user provides. 

### **Now, let's talk about each portion step-by-step**

You can explore `app.py` to see how functions like `get_latest_exp_folder()`, `run_yolo_detection()`, `process_prediction()`, and `read_detected_objects()` work. Additionally, also look at how `execute_research_and_report()` sequentially executes tasks and how `generate_summaried_report()` compiles the final report.  (not too difficult)

### **now let's talk about the `predict` route inside `app.py` the main `endpoint`.

<img width="818" alt="pred1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c6b0224-ef9c-492a-aa07-d8904932bfa4" />

<img width="816" alt="pred2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1a39fc0-1a3d-4404-8df0-10356b3cf149" />

### **Understanding the `/predict` Endpoint**  

The `/predict` route handles image-based crop detection, processes predictions, and triggers AI-powered research for detected plants.  

### **Step 1: Receiving and Decoding Image Data**  
- The endpoint expects a **base64-encoded image** in the JSON request (`request.json["image"]`).  
- The image is **decoded** using `base64.b64decode(data)`, preparing it for processing.  
- A log entry confirms the image has been successfully received and decoded.

### **Step 2: Object Detection and Processing**  
- The decoded image is passed to `process_prediction()`, where:  
  - The image is analyzed, and detected objects are identified.  
  - The function returns `labels_text`, an error (if any), and a **processed image**.  
- If an error occurs, the API returns a **500 error response**, logging the failure.

### **Step 3: Reading Detected Objects**  
- The function `read_detected_objects(DETECTED_OBJECTS_PATH)` reads from `detected_objects.txt`, which contains unique labels (plant names) identified during detection.  
- The detected objects are logged for reference.

### **Step 4: Research and Report Generation**  
- If objects were detected, the system proceeds with **AI-driven research**:  
  - `execute_research_and_report(detected_objects)` triggers research tasks for each plant, retrieving data on:
    - **General Information** (`research_overall_web()`)
    - **Health Benefits & Risks** (`research_health()`)
    - **Growth Conditions & Farming** (`research_season()`)
    - **Market Prices** (`research_price()`)
  - Results are **structured into a dictionary** and stored in `research_results`.  
  - `generate_summarized_report(research_results)` compiles a **summary** of all findings.

- If an error occurs during research, it is logged but does not stop execution.

### **now let's see the beautiful shots how it looks when exposing `port:5000` after running `app.py`**

### **now let's see the send_report in `app.py` that sends the email carrying your `summarized report`

<img width="812" alt="em1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ff53c06-08ce-4a50-be64-9cc4adb12453" />
<img width="803" alt="em2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a86a1ea8-6caf-4fc2-862d-10f5d4fddc9e" />

This route sends the **summarized research report** via email.  

1. **Extracts request data** – Retrieves `email` and `summarized_report`, handling key mismatches.  
2. **Formats the report** – Converts HTML into **plain text**, improving readability.  
3. **Sends the email** – Uses `send_email()`, returning **200** on success or **500** on failure.  
4. **Handles errors** – Logs exceptions and responds accordingly.

*this is `send_email()` 

<img width="815" alt="sem" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7d81141-e1c4-483f-a9f5-1fac8e798e04" />
<img width="803" alt="sem3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9eb5e0ad-4649-476d-9ba8-9b9ed5ed7bd8" /> 

1. **Loads credentials** – Fetches `SENDER_EMAIL` and `SENDER_PASSWORD` from environment variables.  
2. **Validates credentials** – Ensures required SMTP details exist.  
3. **Creates email** – Uses `MIMEMultipart()` to format **subject & body**.  
4. **Sends via Gmail SMTP** – Establishes a **TLS-secured connection**, logs in, and dispatches the email.  
5. **Handles failures** – Logs errors and returns `False` if unsuccessful. 

*this is how summary report looks that the `receipient receives`*

<img width="738" alt="email1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c05a81d-1ec0-419f-94a8-2ef84693f373" />
<img width="737" alt="email2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d74f7a6-21f9-4d32-8ba3-30c53c5730dc" />
<img width="729" alt="email3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5abf160a-7334-4901-8741-01c87e1a0005" />
<img width="728" alt="email4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25cb29c5-849b-4ce1-a28f-c86890349cf1" />

### **this is when `user` clicks `end program` in UI**

<img width="803" alt="end" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b19e3a9d-5205-4c1c-b2fb-3155a571de18" />

Handles **graceful server shutdown** when triggered from the UI.  

1. **Receives request** – Logs the shutdown initiation.  
2. **Starts a separate thread** – Calls `shutdown_server()` to prevent request blocking.  
3. **Delays execution** – Waits **1 second** before exiting.  
4. **Forces server exit** – Calls `os._exit(0)` to terminate the application.  
5. **Handles errors** – Logs any failures and returns an error response if needed.

### Welcome to Deployment and CICD related things 💚🎆🌱

*this is how deployment(CICD) looks like*

![CI_CD Diagram (3)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4016020b-e3ef-49ad-ba9d-5d66a7603945)

### **CI/CD Workflow**
1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
   - Trigger: A new commit is pushed to the `main` branch.
   - Jenkins fetches the latest code from GitHub.
   - Docker image is built with required environment variables.

2. **Continuous Delivery (CD)**:
   - The built image is tagged and pushed to **AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**.

3. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**:
   - The EC2 instance pulls the latest Docker image from ECR.
   - The existing container is stopped and replaced with the new version.
   - The Flask application is restarted with the updated image.

### **Jenkins Credentials Setup**
Make sure you have added the necessary secrets to Jenkins:

1. Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Credentials** > **System** > **Global Credentials** > **Add Credentials**.
2. Add the following credentials:

   - **aws_access_key_id**: Your AWS IAM access key  
   - **aws_secret_access_key**: Your AWS IAM secret key  
   - **openai_api_key**: Your OpenAI API key  
   - **serper_api_key**: Your Serper API key  
   - **sender_password**: Your email sender password  
   - **sender_email**: Your email sender address  
   - **exa_api_key**: Your Exa API key  

### **Note:**  
- The `Jenkinsfile` is located in the root directory and defines the CI/CD pipeline.  
- The `scripts.sh` file in the root directory contains commands to install Docker, Jenkins, and AWS CLI on the EC2 instance.
  
**Reminder:** Running inference on EC2 requires more RAM, and the AWS Free Tier won’t be sufficient.  

We have tested our Jenkins pipeline up to the Docker image build stage. However, during dependency installation and wheel setup, the Jenkins job either crashed or got stuck.  

If you encounter any issues beyond this point in the Jenkins stages, please report them as an issue in this repository, and we will address them as soon as possible (ASAP).

## Guide for Developers 🌿🎇✨💚🎆🌱🎇✨💚🎆

#### ⚠️ **Note for Developers**  

The model I am using in this project **is not the one trained with the modular code approach**. Instead, I trained it separately on **Google Colab using an NVIDIA A100 GPU**.  

Here are the training details:  
- **Dataset**: 25,000 images  
- **Epochs**: 100  
- **Compute**: A100 GPU (Colab Pro)  

If you want to train the model yourself, you are free to choose any **epoch size** based on your **compute resources (and budget 💰)**.  

### 📢 **Dataset Information**  
The dataset is **open-source** and available on **Hugging Face**:  
📌 **[100 Crops & Plants Object Detection Dataset (25K Images)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/devshaheen/100_crops_plants_object_detection_25k_image_dataset)**  

🔗 **Please give credit** if you use this dataset—it took **1.5 months** to annotate all the images!  

### ✅ **Using the Pretrained Model**  
To make things easier, I have already provided the **trained model (`best.pt`)** in the **project root directory**. You can use it directly for inference instead of retraining from scratch. Just check the **project files**, and you’ll find it ready to use! 🚀  

### 🛠 **Train the Model Yourself**  
If you want to train the model on a **larger epoch size**, I have already provided a **Colab Notebook** for training:  `notebooks/leaflogic_detection (soft).ipynb ` 

To train the model, open the notebook in **Google Colab**, adjust the training parameters as needed, and run the training process! 🔥  

### **Dear Developers, ** 

To create a similar project, set up your environment using Python 3.10 or above with Conda:  
```bash  
conda create -p your_env_name python=3.10
```
Activate the env:
```bash
conda activate your_env_path  
```
Then, install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

You can also Run Inside a Docker Container.

The image is available on Docker Hub:  
- **Prerequisite**: Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running on your system.
  
- Pull the image:  
```bash
  docker pull devshaheen/leaflog
```
- Run the container on port 5000:  
```bash
  docker run -it -p 5000:5000 devshaheen/leaflog
```


I recommend using TaskflowAI here because of its modularity design, which is crucial for building scalable AI/ML applications. When productionizing AI or ML apps, having a modular design from the beginning is essential.
You can fork this repo as TaskflowAI is simple and easy to understand. Here is the documentation link: [TaskflowAI Documentation](https://www.taskflowai.org/). Feel free to explore more or contribute. It provides tools to work with multi-AI agents and multi-agent system design easily, and there are also other frameworks such as Langchain's **langgraph**, **crewai**, **phi-data** etc, you can use those too.


Happy coding and building your agritech multi-AI-agent system! 🎉💚
